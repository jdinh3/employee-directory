## Description

This is an employee directory that allows a user to view all of their employees and corresponding information including name, phone number, email, date of birth, and an image. The user is able to search an employee's name in the search bar. As the user types, the table will filter employees to match the user's search. The user is also able to click on the "Name" heading to sort the names by alphabetical order.

## Technologies

This React application breaks down the UI into components (header, search bar, table of employees), manages component state, and responds to user events. The data was generated from randomuser.me API.
